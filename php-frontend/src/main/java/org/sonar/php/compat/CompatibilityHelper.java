/**
 * Provides helper methods to support newer APIs when running in older runtimes.
 *
 * Use "wrap" for objects on which you will want to call methods that may not be available in older runtimes.
 * This helper will use a suitable class depending on the runtime version to implement missing features.
 *
 * Alternative approaches considered:
 *
 * 1. Wrap instances in a class that extends the implementation of the platform (DefaultInputFile).
 * The problem with that is the platform implementation class is internal and should not be used,
 * breaking its encapsulation would be very fragile and therefore dangerous.
 *
 * 2. Instead of wrapping, check the version at each use.
 * The problem with that is the widespread use of if-else statements,
 * which would be impossible to keep track of, and very ugly.
 * Also, the sensor context to get the runtime version is often hard to access.
